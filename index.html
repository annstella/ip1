              <p>I am seventeen years of age.Icompleted high school in the year 2017.Am looking foward to a time when I'll be working and earning my own money.</p>
              <p>After high school,I wanted to venture into ethical hacking,which is something am passionate about.I discovered that I needed to learn about programming
    and decided that I'll take up a class and see to it that I'll be able to do something am passionate about.Living in a world that develops day in day
    out,I thought that this would be the right field to study and that way I am assured that I'll be in the right position to be creative and innovative in terms of technology.</p>
              <p>Am interested in global development,especially technology and its innovation but mostly am interested in music especially <strong>poety</strong> and also art.My hobbies include
    listening to music and singing.But as time goes by,I think my hobbies will change from listening to music to coding.I am good at listening to people especially when they are airing
    their views.I love teamwork though am very good at questioning.</p>

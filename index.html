            <h3>An "About Me" section</h3>
              <p>.I am seventeen years of age.I come from kinoo,a family of three kids,I been the second born.Icompleted high school in the year 2017.Am a very shy person and have a hard time communicating with people,especially new ones,but by the end of the course hopefully,I hope I'll get rid of my shyness.I currently do not have any job experience but am looking foward to a time when I'll be working and earning my own money.</p>
              <p>After high school,I wanted to venture into ethical hacking,which is something am passionate about.I discovered that I needed to learn about programming
    and that is when I decided that I'll take up a class and see to it that I'll be able to do something am passionate about.Living in a world that develops daily,I thought that this would be the right field to study and that way I am assured that I'll be in the right position to be creative and innovative in terms of technology development.</p>
              <p>Am interested in global development,especially technology and its innovation but mostly am interested in music especially <strong>poety</strong> and also art.Am interested in poetry because it they are able to bring out life in either a positive or negative manner but in a meaningful way .My hobbies include
    listening to music and singing.Singing also turns out to be my talent.But as time goes by,I think my hobbies will change from listening to music to coding.I am good at listening to people especially when they are airing
    their views.I love teamwork though am very good at questioning.Am also good at multi-tasking,since am the kind of person who rushes the last minute but still last minute can save a man.</p>
